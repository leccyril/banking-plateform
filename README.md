![Clean architecture.](/images/cleanarchi.webp) 
### The main concepts used in this projects are :
* Hexagonal architecture
* Reactive streams
* MongoDB
* Reactive Mongo
* SpringBoot 3.2
* Rest API

The hexagonal architecture is sa,e as clean architecture but adding port and adaptors, often hexagonal architecture is called clean architecture.
Often in the hegaxonal architecture we do not represent clearly port and adaptor because it is really clear in the code what is what :

Primary adaptors: Rest api controller. (in)
secondary adaptors: Db and external services. (out)

We used mapper and dto juste for the poc, in reality it is often not useful
